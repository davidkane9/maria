## Objective

This site aims to compare the mortality rates estimated in [@kishore2018] to preceding official monthly statistics and comments on the unrealistic differences between the data sets. The site highlights and exemplifies the arguments in [@kane2018] and displays them both visually and mathematically. Finally, this project discusses the implications of statistical discrepancies and their effect on the media coverage of such studies.
