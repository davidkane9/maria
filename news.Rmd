### Making Headlines

After being published, [@kishore2018] attracted significant media coverage from mews agencies around the world due to its drastic findings. Headlines like 
[*"Hurricane Maria death toll in Puerto Rico is thousands higher than official count, study estimates"*](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/puerto-rico-crisis/hurricane-maria-death-toll-puerto-rico-thousands-higher-official-count-n878186) (NBC) 
surfaced the internet and turned many heads due to their unprecedented claims. However, discrepancies between this study and other mortality-related paper's methodologies may actually be exaggerating the severity of hurricane Maria. 



### Methodical Discrepancies

<!-- Generally, disaster mortality studies include deaths directly caused by the event.[@katrina2005], a study on the deaths caused by hurricane Katrina, includes primarily deaths caused by incidences of drowning, injury and trauma over the span of 65 days. This narrow selection yielded a 971 person death-count, a number dwarfed by [@kishore2018]'s supposed 4,645. The vast difference in death tolls is in fact due to [@kishore2018]'s broader selection process which in addition to direct deaths, also accounts for indirect deaths caused by the worsening of chronic conditions, delayed medical treatments and more, Furthermore, [@kishore2018]'s surveys were conducted over a significantly longer period of 102 days.  -->



<!-- Generally, disaster mortality studies include deaths directly caused by the event. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  -->
<!-- describes directs deaths as those that occur *"due to hazards from the physical forces of a hurricane"* [(NOAA)](https://www.noaa.gov/education/explainers/hurricane-safety-explained). -->
<!-- Examples include deaths by flooding, flying debris, or collapsing buildings. This narrow selection criteria yields significantly lower death-counts than [@kishore2018] which additionally also accounts for indirect deaths that occur *"after a hurricane as a result of hurricane damage"* [(NOAA)](https://www.noaa.gov/education/explainers/hurricane-safety-explained). Examples include deaths due to power loss, overexertion during cleanup, generator accidents, and water-borne diseases spread by flooding. Indirect deaths also happen over a longer time period which also increases the overall count. -->


When approximating the loss of life, we characterize the loss as a “direct” death; that is, we attribute the fatality to a physical manifestation of the storm. The most common examples of direct deaths are drowning in storm surge, storm-driven waves, rip currents, or freshwater flood from rain. They also include physical trauma incurred from windborne debris or structural failure induced by wind (tornadic and otherwise) [@BAMS]. Consequently, the official death toll for Hurricane Maria was estimated to be 64 (later increased to 2,975) [@govtoll].  Contrarily, [@kishore2018]'s methodology includes indirect deaths caused by the worsening of chronic conditions, delayed medical treatments and more and thus has a far higher reported death toll of 4,625. The methodical discrepancies mentioned above are ultimately responsible for the varying death counts and the resulting chaotic media coverage
