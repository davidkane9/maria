<!-- ### Making Headlines -->

<!-- After being published, [@kishore2018] attracted significant media coverage from mews agencies around the world due to its drastic findings. Headlines like  -->
<!-- [*"Puerto Rico’s Hurricane Maria Death Toll Could Exceed 4,000, New Study Estimates"*](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/us/puerto-rico-deaths-hurricane.html) (New York Times)  -->
<!-- surfaced the internet and turned many heads due to their unprecedented claims. However, discrepancies between this study and other mortality-related paper's methodologies may actually be exaggerating the severity of hurricane Maria.  -->



<!-- ### Methodical Discrepancies -->

<!-- When approximating the loss of life, we characterize the loss as a “direct” death; that is, we attribute the fatality to a physical manifestation of the storm. The most common examples of direct deaths are drowning in storm surge, storm-driven waves, rip currents, or freshwater flood from rain. They also include physical trauma incurred from windborne debris or structural failure induced by wind (tornadic and otherwise) [@BAMS]. Consequently, the official death toll for Hurricane Maria was estimated to be 64 (later increased to 2,975) [@govtoll]. Contrarily, [@kishore2018]'s methodology includes indirect deaths caused by the worsening of chronic conditions, delayed medical treatments and more and thus has a far higher reported death toll of 4,625. The methodical discrepancies mentioned above are ultimately responsible for the varying death counts and the resulting chaotic media coverage -->



### How typical storm mortality is measured

When approximating the loss of life, we characterize the loss as a “direct” death; that is, we attribute the fatality to a physical manifestation of the storm [@BAMS]. The most common examples of direct deaths are drowning in storm surge, storm-driven waves, rip currents, or freshwater flood from rain. They also include physical trauma incurred from windborne debris or structural failure induced by wind (tornadic and otherwise). Consequently, the official death toll for Hurricane Maria was estimated to be [64](https://www.telemundopr.com/noticias/puerto-rico/aumentan-a-64-las-muertes-por-el-huracan-maria/10690/).

### What happened after the study was published

Unlike previous official studies, [@kishore2018]'s methodology includes indirect deaths caused by the worsening of chronic conditions, delayed medical treatments and more. It thus has a far higher reported death toll of 4,625 as compared to other official studies. The differences in the definition of "excess mortality" between [@kishore2018] and the official study was ignored by the general media and lead to headlines such as [*"Puerto Rico’s Hurricane Maria Death Toll Could Exceed 4,000, New Study Estimates"*](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/us/puerto-rico-deaths-hurricane.html) (New York Times) and many subsequently flawed investigations. These consequently lead to public chaos and the presumed severity of the hurricane being inconsistent. Following the public outcry, the government of Puerto Rico "updated" its original mortality to 2,975 [@govtoll], yet another confusing and inconsistent figure.
