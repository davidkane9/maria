## Correspondence
### Initial Response [@kane2018]
#### Author: David Kane
The excess mortality estimates
reported by Kishore et al. for the 102 days after
Hurricane Maria depend on the quality of their
data. I examined that quality by calculating mortality
for the 263 days before Maria and then
comparing that rate with those from other sources.
Using the authors’ methodology and data, I calculate
the mortality as 2.6 deaths (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.8)
per 1000 persons from January 1 through September
19, 2017. This rate is inconsistent with
the rate calculated on the basis of the official
monthly statistics for 2010 through 2017: 8.3
deaths (95% CI, 8.2 to 8.4) per 1000 persons. It is
almost statistically impossible for there to have
been only 18 deaths in the 3299 households before
Maria. The problem remains even when the
authors’ later calculations, which adjusted for
household size, are taken into account.

> It is important to note that our study shed
light not only on excess deaths but also on the
possibility of prolonged, indirect effects of the
hurricane, as well as causes of death and infrastructure
disruption.

Although this was mentioned early in the paper, it should have been thoroughly clarified that this paper's method differs from other official papers in the way that deaths are counted. The authors should have declared that the paper's findings are not directly comparable to the official death count and would have thus prevented public confusion.

>The limitations of the use
of post-disaster surveys to calculate mortality or
excess deaths are well articulated in the literature. We attempted to address known challenges
with sampling, stratification, and biases
in the methods we adopted. 
As noted by Kane, the raw, prehurricane estimates of mortality
from our survey were lower than historical averages.
We have addressed this issue in detail, both
in a Technical FAQ (https://github.com/c2-d2/pr_mort_official/blob/master/misc/technical-faq.pdf)
and in a public discussion forum with
Kane in June 2018 (https://github.com/c2-d2/pr_mort_official/issues/7).


The adjustments made to address these sampling, stratification, and bias challenges proved to not work. According to the Technical FAQ the low pre-hurricane death rate was 2.6 per 1000 which was due to the underestimation of single-person households. Omitting this demographic did not work and yielded a low pre-hurricane mortality rate of 2.78 because it largely influenced the data as many single residents are senior citizens. Again, this important detail should have been mentioned in the paper. Finally, the pre-hurricane rate was then mathematically adjusted to equal a more plausible 7.72 deaths per 1000 however, this adjustment yields an implausibly high post-hurricane mortality rate of 18.2 per 1000. Thus, the adjustments alone do not seems to be reliable.

>We were aware of this
issue and did not use prehurricane data for any
of the estimates reported in our article.

That is a bug, not a feature, of the paper. It is good that the authors compare various measures from the survey with ACS data. But then why did they not compare the pre-Maria mortality rate from the survey with the official statistics? That seems like a big oversight. After all, this is a paper about mortality! There is no more important way to judge the quality of the survey than to see if it got pre-Maria mortality "correct."

>We also
note that when single-person households and
age structure are included in the estimate, this
low rate is brought within the range of the 2016
death rate for Puerto Rico. The code and data
required for this analysis are available at the link
to the public discussion forum, above.

As mentioned earlier, although the adjustment brings the pre-hurricane rate close to the official numbers, the resulting post-hurricane mortality rate is exorbitantly high

## Discussion

The author's reply to the initial response fails to appropriately address the issues brought forth by Kane. The primary issue in Kane's initial response states that the death rates as per [@kishore2018]'s calculations are drastically lower than the official statistics. In their response, Balsari et. al state that this is due to the underrepresentation of single-person households, and once mathematically adjusted, the figures do align. However, should this adjustment be made to [@kishore2018]'s post-hurricane rates as well, it results in an implausibly high figure (CI = [12.6, 24.4]). The discrepancies in the data suggest that the adjustments and/or the data collection are not accurate.
