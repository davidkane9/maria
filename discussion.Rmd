## Correspondance
### Initial Response
#### Author: David Kane
The excess mortality estimates
reported by Kishore et al. for the 102 days after
Hurricane Maria depend on the quality of their
data. I examined that quality by calculating mortality
for the 263 days before Maria and then
comparing that rate with those from other sources.
Using the authors’ methodology and data, I calculate
the mortality as 2.6 deaths (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.8)
per 1000 persons from January 1 through September
19, 2017. This rate is inconsistent with
the rate calculated on the basis of the official
monthly statistics for 2010 through 2017: 8.3
deaths (95% CI, 8.2 to 8.4) per 1000 persons. It is
almost statistically impossible for there to have
been only 18 deaths in the 3299 households before
Maria. The problem remains even when the
authors’ later calculations, which adjusted for
household size, are taken into account.


### Author's Reply 
#### Author: Satchit Balsari, Caroline O. Buckee, Rafael A. Irizarry,

It is important to note that our study shed
light not only on excess deaths but also on the
possibility of prolonged, indirect effects of the
hurricane, as well as causes of death and infrastructure
disruption. The limitations of the use
of post-disaster surveys to calculate mortality or
excess deaths are well articulated in the literature. We attempted to address known challenges
with sampling, stratification, and biases
in the methods we adopted. As noted by Kane,
the raw, prehurricane estimates of mortality
from our survey were lower than historical averages.
We have addressed this issue in detail, both
in a Technical FAQ (https://github.com/c2-d2/pr_mort_official/blob/master/misc/technical-faq.pdf)
and in a public discussion forum with
Kane in June 2018 (https://github.com/c2-d2/pr_mort_official/issues/7).
We were aware of this
issue and did not use prehurricane data for any
of the estimates reported in our article. We also
note that when single-person households and
age structure are included in the estimate, this
low rate is brought within the range of the 2016
death rate for Puerto Rico. The code and data
required for this analysis are available at the link
to the public discussion forum, above.

## Discussion

The author's reply to the initial response fails to appropriately address the issues brought forth by Kane. The primary issue in Kane's initial response states that the death rates as per [@kishore2018]'s calculations are drastically lower than the official statistics. In their response, Balsari et. al state that this is due to the underrepresentation of single-person households, and once mathematically adjusted, the figures do align. However, should this adjustment be made to [@kishore2018]'s post-hurricane rates as well, it results in an implausibly high figure (CI = [12.6, 24.4]). The discrepancies in the data suggest that the adjustments and/or the data collection are not accurate.
