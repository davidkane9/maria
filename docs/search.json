I examined that quality by calculating mortality for the 263 days before Maria and then comparing that rate with those from other sources. Using the authors’ methodology and data, I calculate the mortality as 2.6 deaths (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.8) per 1000 persons from January 1 through September 19, 2017. This rate is inconsistent with the rate calculated on the basis of the official monthly statistics for 2010 through 2017: 8.3 deaths (95% CI, 8.2 to 8.4) per 1000 persons. It is almost statistically impossible for there to have been only 18 deaths in the 3299 households before Maria. The problem remains even when the authors’ later calculations, which adjusted for household size, are taken into account.\nAnnotated Section of Author’s Reply (Satchit Balsari 2018)\nAuthor: Satchit Balsari, Caroline O. Buckee, Rafael A. Irizarry,\n\nIt is important to note that our study shed light not only on excess deaths but also on the possibility of prolonged, indirect effects of the hurricane, as well as causes of death and infrastructure disruption. The limitations of the use of post-disaster surveys to calculate mortality or excess deaths are well articulated in the literature. We attempted to address known challenges with sampling, stratification, and biases in the methods we adopted.\n\nThese sentence do not answer any aspects of Kane’s critique.\n\nAs noted by Kane, the raw, prehurricane estimates of mortality from our survey were lower than historical averages.\n\nThis should have been mentioned in the paper. Also, saying pre-hurricane estimates are “lower” is an understatement. Complete inconsistency with historical data is a large issue\n\nWe have addressed this issue in detail, both in a Technical FAQ (https://github.com/c2-d2/pr_mort_official/blob/master/misc/technical-faq.pdf) and in a public discussion forum with Kane in June 2018 (https://github.com/c2-d2/pr_mort_official/issues/7).\n\nFrom Technical FAQ:\n\nAs mentioned in the paper, our survey is unable to capture deaths in single-person households. This introduces a bias that results in underestimation of both before and after the hurricane. The death rate in single-person households is found to be 0 — this cannot be true. First, the median age in this single-person households is 69. Second, this death rate is expected because we missed (i.e., could not count) the single-person households where there had been a death (as there was no one to answer the door!)\n\nThese details were not explained thoroughly enough in the paper. The paper mentioned that single person households were under-counted but did not explain the reasoning and impact of this issue. This comment raises the fundamental quandary in which the authors’ find themselves. The number of deaths from before the hurricane is implausibly low. Any proposal to “adjust” those rates upwards requires that the same adjustment be applied to the death totals after the hurricane. Any set of adjustments which generate pre-maria mortality estimates within the historical range would lead to implausibly high post-maria mortality estimates.\n\nRemoving all households with the size of one increases the “before estimate” but not by much. However, it is important to note that the households of size one appeared to be older, on average, than other households which likely results in an underestimate of the mortality rate if we simply remove these from our analysis. An alternative approach would be to plug in a more realistic rate for these households and then adjust for the bias favoring larger households. We took the conservative approach and plugged in the same rate for both before and after the hurricane. To compute a confidence interval we use Keyfitz’s approximation.\n\n\n\nRate_before\n\n\nbefore_lower\n\n\nbefore_upper\n\n\nrate_after\n\n\nafter_lower\n\n\nafter_upper\n\n\n7.72\n\n\n4.16\n\n\n11.3\n\n\n18.2\n\n\n12.4\n\n\n24\n\n\nMathematically adjusting the pre-hurricane mortality rate to a more plausible 7.72 (CI = [4.16, 11.3]) deaths per 1000 is valid. However, this adjustment yields an implausibly high post-hurricane mortality rate of 18.2 per 1000 (CI = [12.6, 24.4]). This implies that 60,736 people died as opposed to the historical 29,340 and suggests that an extra 31,396 people died. In other words, corpses would be piling on the streets. Thus, the adjustments make no sense.\nBack to NEJM Reply\n\nWe were aware of this issue and did not use prehurricane data for any of the estimates reported in our article.\n\nThat is a bug, not a feature, of the paper. It is good that the authors compare various measures from the survey with ACS data. But then why did they not compare the pre-Maria mortality rate from the survey with the official statistics? That seems like a big oversight. After all, this is a paper about mortality! There is no more important way to judge the quality of the survey than to see if it got pre-Maria mortality “correct.” In essence, this is a damning admission because they never mentioned this issue in the paper (the number (5.5) should be given).\n\nWe also note that when single-person households and age structure are included in the estimate, this low rate is brought within the range of the 2016 death rate for Puerto Rico. The code and data required for this analysis are available at the link to the public discussion forum, above.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, although the adjustment brings the pre-hurricane rate close to the official numbers, the resulting post-hurricane mortality rate is implausibly high\nDiscussion\nThe author’s reply to the initial response fails to appropriately address the issues brought forth by Kane. The primary issue in Kane’s initial response states that the death rates as per (Kishore N 2018)’s calculations are drastically lower than the official statistics. In their response, Balsari et. al state that this is due to the underrepresentation of single-person households, and once mathematically adjusted, the figures do align. However, should this adjustment be made to (Kishore N 2018)’s post-hurricane rates as well, it results in an implausibly high figure (CI = [12.6, 24.4]). The discrepancies in the data suggest that the adjustments and/or the data collection are not accurate.\n\n\n\n\n\nKane, D. 2018. “Mortality in Puerto Rico After Hurricane Maria.” N Engl J Med. https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc1810872.\n\n\nKishore N, Mahmud A, Marqués D. 2018. “Mortality in Puerto Rico After Hurricane Maria.” N Engl J Med. https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMsa1803972.\n\n\nSatchit Balsari, Rafael A.

Rappaport 2016). The most common examples of direct deaths are drowning in storm surge, storm-driven waves, rip currents, or freshwater flood from rain. They also include physical trauma incurred from windborne debris or structural failure induced by wind (tornadic and otherwise). The official death toll for Hurricane Maria was determined to be 64.\nWhat happened (Timeline)\nSeptember 16, 2017, 11:00 AM\nThe National Hurricane Center anticipates a tropical storm and issues a forecast for “Potential Tropical Cyclone 15.”\nSeptember 16, 2017, 5:00 PM\nThe NCH renames “Potential Tropical Cyclone 15” to “Tropical Storm Maria” and warns about landfall on the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico.\nSeptember 17, 2017\nThe storm is now classified as a hurricane. The National Weather Service suggests landfall will happen middal on Wednesday, September 20.\nSeptember 20, 2017, 6:15 AM\nHurricane Maria makes landfall with maximum sustained winds of 155 miles per hour. The storm knocks out power to the entire island.\nSeptember 27, 2017\nThe Puerto Rican government announces a that 16 people died in the storm.\nOctober 3, 2017\nGovernor Roselló issues an update to the island’s official death toll increasing it to 34 people.\nOctober 2017\nThe Puerto Rican government updates the official death toll (direct deaths) to 64 people.\nMay 2018\nA pre-release version of (Kishore N 2018) is published in the New England Journal of Medicine and reveals that according to their study, the hurricane’s mortality rate should be 4,625.\nMay-June 2018\n(Kishore N 2018) gains traction and starts making headlines such as the following:\n“Puerto Rico’s Hurricane Maria Death Toll Could Exceed 4,000, New Study Estimates” (The New York Times)\n“New Study Puts Hurricane Maria Death Toll in Puerto Rico at 4,600” (The Wall Street Journal)\n“Harvard study estimates thousands died in Puerto Rico because of Hurricane Maria” (The Washington Post)\nNone of these initial articles included the important differences between (Kishore N 2018)’s study other official ones. As a result, (Kishore N 2018) was compared to the official death count even though one included indirect deaths and the other did not. Consequently, the presumed severity of the hurricane Maria was inconsistent.\nJuly 2018\nThe final version of (Kishore N 2018) is published.\nAugust 2018\nThe government of Puerto Rico commissions (George Washington University 2018). The study publishes an estimated mortality of 2,975.\n\n\n\n\nEdward N. Rappaport, B.
