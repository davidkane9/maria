The site highlights and exemplifies the arguments in (Kane 2018) and displays them both visually and mathematically. Finally, this project discusses the implications of statistical discrepancies and their effect on the media coverage of such studies.\nContact\nDavid Kane\nEmail: dave.kane@gmail.com\nGitHub\nShreeram Patkar\nEmail: patkar.shr@gmail.com\nGitHub\n\n\n\nKane, D. 2018. “Mortality in Puerto Rico After Hurricane Maria.” N Engl J Med. https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc1810872.\n\n\nKishore N, Mahmud A, Marqués D. 2018. “Mortality in Puerto Rico After Hurricane Maria.” N Engl J Med. https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMsa1803972.\n\n\n\n\n",

Headlines like “Hurricane Maria death toll in Puerto Rico is thousands higher than official count, study estimates” (NBC) surfaced the internet and turned many heads due to their unprecedented claims. However, discrepancies between this study and other mortality-related paper’s methodologies may actually be exaggerating the severity of hurricane Maria.\nMethodical Discrepancies\nGenerally, disaster mortality studies include deaths directly caused by the event. (Joan Brunkard 2005), a study on the deaths caused by hurricane Katrina, includes primarily deaths caused by incidences of drowning, injury and trauma over the span of 65 days. This narrow selection yielded a 971 person death-count, a number dwarfed by (Kishore N 2018)’s supposed 4,645. The vast difference in death tolls is in fact due to (Kishore N 2018)’s broader selection process which in addition to direct deaths, also accounts for indirect deaths caused by the worsening of chronic conditions, delayed medical treatments and more, Furthermore, (Kishore N 2018)’s surveys were conducted over a significantly longer period of 102 days.\n\n\n\nJoan Brunkard, Raoult Ratard, Gonza Namulanda. 2005. “Hurricane Katrina Deaths, Louisiana, 2005.” Disaster Med Public Health Preparadness. https://doi.org/10.1097/DMP.0b013e31818aaf55.\n\n\nKishore N, Mahmud A, Marqués D. 2018. “Mortality in Puerto Rico After Hurricane Maria.” N Engl J Med. https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMsa1803972.\n\n\n\n\n",
