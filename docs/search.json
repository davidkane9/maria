The site highlights and exemplifies the arguments in (Kane 2018) and displays them both visually and mathematically. Finally, this project discusses the implications of statistical discrepancies and their effect on the media coverage of such studies.\nContact\nDavid Kane\nEmail: dave.kane@gmail.com\nGitHub\nShreeram Patkar\nEmail: patkar.shr@gmail.com\nGitHub\n\n\n\nKane, D. 2018. “Mortality in Puerto Rico After Hurricane Maria.” N Engl J Med. https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc1810872.\n\n\nKishore N, Mahmud A, Marqués D. 2018. “Mortality in Puerto Rico After Hurricane Maria.” N Engl J Med. https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMsa1803972.\n\n\n\n\n",

I examined that quality by calculating mortality for the 263 days before Maria and then comparing that rate with those from other sources. Using the authors’ methodology and data, I calculate the mortality as 2.6 deaths (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.8) per 1000 persons from January 1 through September 19, 2017. This rate is inconsistent with the rate calculated on the basis of the official monthly statistics for 2010 through 2017: 8.3 deaths (95% CI, 8.2 to 8.4) per 1000 persons. It is almost statistically impossible for there to have been only 18 deaths in the 3299 households before Maria. The problem remains even when the authors’ later calculations, which adjusted for household size, are taken into account.\nAuthor’s Reply\nAuthor: Satchit Balsari, Caroline O. Buckee, Rafael A. Irizarry,\nIt is important to note that our study shed light not only on excess deaths but also on the possibility of prolonged, indirect effects of the hurricane, as well as causes of death and infrastructure disruption. The limitations of the use of post-disaster surveys to calculate mortality or excess deaths are well articulated in the literature. We attempted to address known challenges with sampling, stratification, and biases in the methods we adopted. As noted by Kane, the raw, prehurricane estimates of mortality from our survey were lower than historical averages. We have addressed this issue in detail, both in a Technical FAQ (https://github.com/c2-d2/pr_mort_official/blob/master/misc/technical-faq.pdf) and in a public discussion forum with Kane in June 2018 (https://github.com/c2-d2/pr_mort_official/issues/7). We were aware of this issue and did not use prehurricane data for any of the estimates reported in our article. We also note that when single-person households and age structure are included in the estimate, this low rate is brought within the range of the 2016 death rate for Puerto Rico. The code and data required for this analysis are available at the link to the public discussion forum, above.\nDiscussion\nThe author’s reply to the initial response fails to appropriately address the issues brought forth by Kane. The primary issue in Kane’s initial response states that the death rates as per (Kishore N 2018)’s calculations are drastically lower than the official statistics. In their response, Balsari et. al state that this is due to the underrepresentation of single-person households, and once mathematically adjusted, the figures do align. However, should this adjustment be made to (Kishore N 2018)’s post-hurricane rates as well, it results in an implausibly high figure (CI = [12.6, 24.4]). The discrepancies in the data suggest that the adjustments and/or the data collection are not accurate.\n\n\n\n\n\nKane, D. 2018. “Mortality in Puerto Rico After Hurricane Maria.” N Engl J Med. https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc1810872.\n\n\nKishore N, Mahmud A, Marqués D. 2018. “Mortality in Puerto Rico After Hurricane Maria.” N Engl J Med. https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMsa1803972.\n\n\n\n\n",

Headlines like “Hurricane Maria death toll in Puerto Rico is thousands higher than official count, study estimates” (NBC) surfaced the internet and turned many heads due to their unprecedented claims. However, discrepancies between this study and other mortality-related paper’s methodologies may actually be exaggerating the severity of hurricane Maria.\nMethodical Discrepancies\n\n\n\n\nWhen approximating the loss of life, we characterize the loss as a “direct” death; that is, we attribute the fatality to a physical manifestation of the storm. The most common examples of direct deaths are drowning in storm surge, storm-driven waves, rip currents, or freshwater flood from rain. They also include physical trauma incurred from windborne debris or structural failure induced by wind (tornadic and otherwise) (Edward N. Rappaport 2016). Consequently, the official death toll for Hurricane Maria was estimated to be 64 (later increased to 2,975) (Alexis R. Santos-Lozada 2018). Contrarily, (Kishore N 2018)’s methodology includes indirect deaths caused by the worsening of chronic conditions, delayed medical treatments and more and thus has a far higher reported death toll of 4,625. The methodical discrepancies mentioned above are ultimately responsible for the varying death counts and the resulting chaotic media coverage\n\n\n\nAlexis R. Santos-Lozada, Jeffrey T.
