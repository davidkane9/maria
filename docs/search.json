I examined that quality by calculating mortality for the 263 days before Maria and then comparing that rate with those from other sources. Using the authors’ methodology and data, I calculate the mortality as 2.6 deaths (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.8) per 1000 persons from January 1 through September 19, 2017. This rate is inconsistent with the rate calculated on the basis of the official monthly statistics for 2010 through 2017: 8.3 deaths (95% CI, 8.2 to 8.4) per 1000 persons. It is almost statistically impossible for there to have been only 18 deaths in the 3299 households before Maria. The problem remains even when the authors’ later calculations, which adjusted for household size, are taken into account.\r\nAnnotated Section of Author’s Reply (Satchit Balsari 2018)\r\nAuthor: Satchit Balsari, Caroline O. Buckee, Rafael A. Irizarry,\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that our study shed light not only on excess deaths but also on the possibility of prolonged, indirect effects of the hurricane, as well as causes of death and infrastructure disruption.\r\n\r\nAlthough this was mentioned early in the paper, it should have been thoroughly clarified that this paper’s method differs from other official papers in the way that deaths are counted. The authors should have declared that the paper’s findings are not directly comparable to the official death count and would have thus prevented public confusion.\r\n\r\nThe limitations of the use of post-disaster surveys to calculate mortality or excess deaths are well articulated in the literature. We attempted to address known challenges with sampling, stratification, and biases in the methods we adopted. As noted by Kane, the raw, prehurricane estimates of mortality from our survey were lower than historical averages. We have addressed this issue in detail, both in a Technical FAQ (https://github.com/c2-d2/pr_mort_official/blob/master/misc/technical-faq.pdf) and in a public discussion forum with Kane in June 2018 (https://github.com/c2-d2/pr_mort_official/issues/7).\r\n\r\nThe adjustments made to address these sampling, stratification, and bias challenges proved to not work. According to the Technical FAQ the low pre-hurricane death rate was 2.6 per 1000 which was due to the underestimation of single-person households. Omitting this demographic did not work and yielded a low pre-hurricane mortality rate of 2.78 because it largely influenced the data as many single residents are senior citizens. Again, this important detail should have been mentioned in the paper. Finally, the pre-hurricane rate was then mathematically adjusted to equal a more plausible 7.72 deaths per 1000 however, this adjustment yields an implausibly high post-hurricane mortality rate of 18.2 per 1000. Thus, the adjustments alone do not seems to be reliable.\r\n\r\nWe were aware of this issue and did not use prehurricane data for any of the estimates reported in our article.\r\n\r\nThat is a bug, not a feature, of the paper. It is good that the authors compare various measures from the survey with ACS data. But then why did they not compare the pre-Maria mortality rate from the survey with the official statistics? That seems like a big oversight. After all, this is a paper about mortality! There is no more important way to judge the quality of the survey than to see if it got pre-Maria mortality “correct.”\r\n\r\nWe also note that when single-person households and age structure are included in the estimate, this low rate is brought within the range of the 2016 death rate for Puerto Rico. The code and data required for this analysis are available at the link to the public discussion forum, above.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, although the adjustment brings the pre-hurricane rate close to the official numbers, the resulting post-hurricane mortality rate is exorbitantly high\r\nDiscussion\r\nThe author’s reply to the initial response fails to appropriately address the issues brought forth by Kane. The primary issue in Kane’s initial response states that the death rates as per (Kishore N 2018)’s calculations are drastically lower than the official statistics. In their response, Balsari et. al state that this is due to the underrepresentation of single-person households, and once mathematically adjusted, the figures do align. However, should this adjustment be made to (Kishore N 2018)’s post-hurricane rates as well, it results in an implausibly high figure (CI = [12.6, 24.4]). The discrepancies in the data suggest that the adjustments and/or the data collection are not accurate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKane, D. 2018. “Mortality in Puerto Rico After Hurricane Maria.” N Engl J Med. https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc1810872.\r\n\r\n\r\nKishore N, Mahmud A, Marqués D. 2018. “Mortality in Puerto Rico After Hurricane Maria.” N Engl J Med. https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMsa1803972.\r\n\r\n\r\nSatchit Balsari, Rafael A.

Rappaport 2016). The most common examples of direct deaths are drowning in storm surge, storm-driven waves, rip currents, or freshwater flood from rain. They also include physical trauma incurred from windborne debris or structural failure induced by wind (tornadic and otherwise). Consequently, the official death toll for Hurricane Maria was estimated to be 64.\r\nWhat happened after the study was published\r\nUnlike previous official studies, (Kishore N 2018)’s methodology includes indirect deaths caused by the worsening of chronic conditions, delayed medical treatments and more. It thus has a far higher reported death toll of 4,625 as compared to other official studies. The differences in the definition of “excess mortality” between (Kishore N 2018) and the official study was ignored by the general media and lead to headlines such as “Puerto Rico’s Hurricane Maria Death Toll Could Exceed 4,000, New Study Estimates” (New York Times) and many subsequently flawed investigations. These consequently lead to public chaos and the presumed severity of the hurricane being inconsistent. Following the public outcry, the government of Puerto Rico “updated” its original mortality to 2,975 (Alexis R. Santos-Lozada 2018), yet another confusing and inconsistent figure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexis R. Santos-Lozada, Jeffrey T.
